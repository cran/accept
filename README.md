# accept
R package for the ACute COPD Exacerbation Prediction Tool (ACCEPT)

Please refer to the published paper for more information: 

Adibi A, Sin DD, Safari A, Jonhson KM, Aaron SD, FitzGerald JM, Sadatsafavi M. The Acute COPD Exacerbation Prediction Tool (ACCEPT): a modelling study. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. Published Online First 2020 March 13th; [doi:10.1016/S2213-2600(19)30397-2](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600%2819%2930397-2/fulltext)

## Installation

The latest stable version can be downloaded from CRAN:  
`install.packages ('accept')`

Alternatively, you can download the latest development version from GitHub:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("resplab/accept")
```

# Web App for ACCEPT 

ACCEPT is also available as web app, accessible at [http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/accept](http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/accept)

# ACCEPT in R

### Sample Data

To get started, there is an R data frame with the package of sample patient data. I have printed columns 1-13 and 14-19 separately because there isn't enough space:

```
library(accept)
samplePatients <- accept::samplePatients

```

### Exacerbation Prediction

To get a prediction for exacerbation rate, you will need to pass in a patient vector:

```
results <- predictACCEPT(samplePatients[1,])
print(t(results))
```

The **predictACCEPT()** function returns a data frame with the original patient data, along with the predictions for different treatment options. 

To visualize the data, there is a graphing function called **plotExacerbations()**, which creates a Plotly bar graph. You have the option of selecting **probability** or **rate** for which prediction you want to see, and either **CI** or **PI** to select the confidence interval or prediction interval respectively.

```
plotExacerbations(results, type="probability", interval = "CI")
```

```
plotExacerbations(results, type="probability", interval = "PI")
```

```
plotExacerbations(results, type="rate", interval = "CI")
```

### Probability of N Exacerbations (Poisson)

We can also calculate the predicted number of exacerbations in a year:

```
patientResults = predictACCEPT(samplePatients[1,])
exacerbationsMatrix = predictCountProb(patientResults, n = 10, shortened = TRUE)
print(exacerbationsMatrix)
```

The shortened parameter groups the probabilities from 3-10 exacerbations into one category, "3 or more exacerbations." To see all n exacerbation probabilities:

```
exacerbationsMatrix = predictCountProb(patientResults, n = 10, shortened = FALSE)
print(exacerbationsMatrix)
```

To visualize the matrix as a heatmap, we can use the function **plotHeatMap**:

```
plotHeatMap(patientResults, shortened = FALSE)
```

## Cloud-based API Access 

The [PRISM platform](http://prism.resp.core.ubc.ca) allows users to access ACCEPT through the cloud. A MACRO-enabled Excel-file can be used to interact with the model and see the results. To download the PRISM Excel template file for ACCEPT, please refer to the [PRISM model repository](http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/prism).

## User Manual

An interactive user manual that describes the study, the web app, the API, and the R package is available [here](https://resplab.github.io/acceptManual/section-introduction.html).
